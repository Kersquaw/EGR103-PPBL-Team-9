# EGR103-PPBL-Team-9
University of Kentucky EGR103-003 Repository for all code and documentation for the Team 9 Ping Pong Ball Launcher project.

This is a collection of useful MATLAB scripts and functions that may be used with the "Ping Pong Ball Launcher" semester project.
Any code found here is free to use by any who stop by, but it is highly recommended that you ONLY TAKE INSPIRATION from the code.
If you copypasta my code, I cannot guarentee the integrity of your grade as well as the group you work with!!!

That being said, GO CATS!
